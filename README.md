# Olio Interview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run Instructions

1. Install packages with: `npm install`
2. Run in develop mode: `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Test run Instructions

Run `npm test` to run jest tests

### Lauren's next step if I had more time

- If the api had the option of limiting the number of requests pagination could be handled on the back end
- extract out the getBounds function and simplify
- error handling on fetchArticles
- error page
- pagination
- change icon
- add header for olio
- use tailwind
- styling in container use breakpoints
- remove duplicate code from atricle details page
- wouldn't use actual ids in url
- article data page better destructure
- clicking on pin on map should scroll to the option in the list
- add back to homepage
- use cookies instead of local storage?
- check dependencies are dependencies not dev dependencies
- Accessibility
- convert fetch to use async await

### To Do

- code comments
- styling

### Dependencies

I used [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) for the map functionality and [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) for the tiles. In a live project I would make sure to include the copyright links and documentation.
